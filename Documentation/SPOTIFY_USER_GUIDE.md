## Troubleshooting

### "No active Spotify device found"

**Problem:** Aura can't find a device to play music on.

**Solution:**
1. Open Spotify on **any device** (desktop app, phone, tablet, speaker)
2. Play a song for a few seconds, then pause it
3. This "activates" the device for Spotify Connect
4. Try your Aura voice command again

**Note:** Aura uses Spotify Connect, meaning it controls playback on your existing Spotify devices. It doesn't stream audio directly.

---

### "Spotify Premium required"

**Problem:** You don't have Spotify Premium.

**Solution:**
- Unfortunately, Spotify's API requires Premium for playback control
- Upgrade to Spotify Premium at [spotify.com/premium](https://www.spotify.com/premium)
- Free accounts can still browse but cannot control playback

---

### "Spotify not connected" Error

**Problem:** OAuth tokens expired or were deleted.

**Solution:**
1. Go to Settings â†’ Spotify Integration
2. Click "Disconnect" if you see it
3. Click "Connect Spotify" again
4. Re-authorize in the browser

---

### Songs Not Playing / Wrong Song

**Problem:** Voice recognition isn't perfect, or song isn't available.

**Solutions:**
- Speak clearly and include the artist name: "Play [song] by [artist]"
- Use the exact song title if possible
- Check if the song is available in your region on Spotify
- Try searching manually in Spotify first to verify the exact name

---

### Authorization Page Doesn't Open

**Problem:** Browser doesn't open when clicking "Connect Spotify".

**Solution:**
1. Check your default browser is set correctly
2. Manually open: [https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize](https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize)
3. Try a different browser
4. Check firewall/antivirus isn't blocking the connection

---

### "Failed to refresh access token"

**Problem:** Automatic token refresh failed.

**Solution:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Go to Settings â†’ Spotify Integration
3. Disconnect and reconnect Spotify
4. If the problem persists, check [Spotify Status](https://status.spotify.com) for outages

---

## Privacy & Security

### Your Data is Safe

**Nivora Aura takes your privacy seriously:**

âœ… **No Client Secret Stored** - We use PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange), the most secure OAuth2 flow
âœ… **Tokens in OS Keyring** - Your access tokens are stored in your system's native credential manager:
  - **macOS**: Keychain
  - **Windows**: Credential Manager
  - **Linux**: Secret Service (libsecret)

âœ… **No Telemetry** - We never send your listening data or commands to any server
âœ… **Local Processing** - All voice recognition happens on your device
âœ… **Minimal Permissions** - We only request the scopes needed for playback control

### What Spotify Knows

When you authorize Aura:
- Spotify knows that "Nivora Aura" (your app name) is accessing your account
- Spotify logs API calls (what songs you play, when you pause, etc.)
- **Aura does not send any additional analytics to anyone**

### Disconnecting

To revoke access at any time:
1. **In Aura**: Settings â†’ Spotify Integration â†’ Disconnect
2. **In Spotify**: [Account Settings](https://www.spotify.com/account/apps/) â†’ Remove "Nivora Aura"

---

## FAQ

### Q: Do I need to keep the browser open after connecting?

**A:** No! Once you see "Spotify Connected!" you can close the browser. Aura has the tokens it needs.

---

### Q: How long does the connection last?

**A:** Indefinitely! Aura automatically refreshes your access token before it expires. You should never need to re-authorize unless you explicitly disconnect.

---

### Q: Can I use this without Spotify Premium?

**A:** Unfortunately, no. Spotify's API requires Premium for playback control. You need an active Premium subscription.

---

### Q: What if I have multiple Spotify devices?

**A:** Great! Spotify Connect works across all your devices. Music will play on whichever device was most recently active. You can change the active device in the Spotify app.

---

### Q: Can Aura play music from other services (Apple Music, YouTube Music)?

**A:** Not yet! Spotify is our first music integration. Other services may be added in the future based on user demand.

---

### Q: Does this work offline?

**A:** No. Music playback requires:
- Internet connection (to call Spotify's API)
- Active Spotify device (streaming from Spotify)

However, **voice recognition is 100% offline** - your commands are processed locally.

---

### Q: Why do I need to create a Spotify Developer app?

**A:** This is for **your security and privacy**. By creating your own app:
- You control the Client ID (we don't store it on our servers)
- You can revoke access anytime from your Spotify account
- We can't access your account without your explicit authorization
- This follows industry best practices for OAuth2 security

---

### Q: What voice models work best for music commands?

**A:** All STT models work! For best results:
- Use "Base" or "Small" Whisper models (Settings â†’ Voice Settings)
- Speak clearly and at a normal pace
- Include artist names for more accurate results
